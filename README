This is the first part of the research project that observed the Fama and French Three Factor Model's SMB. We added an international factor by examing beta and
gamma coefficients. Gamma was calculated in a regression with comparison to the VEA (developed markets) and VEMAX (emerging markets). Portfolios were created by
weighting each gamma based on market capitalization and sorting based on weighted gamma. Other backtests were involved especially one with regards to SMB. Here we
created 15 equally weighted portfolios, double sorted with respect to market cap size of the firm and then their international exposure. More details are offered
in the paper and code in this repository.
